# AutoSignAPK
I've made an batch script to automate APK signing. Just set it up by starting Autosign.bat, fill in the information of your keystore, copy the keystore to the same folder and finish the setup. 

Every time you move an APK file called "android-release-unsigned" to the folder, and click the bat file, it will automatically sign it!
